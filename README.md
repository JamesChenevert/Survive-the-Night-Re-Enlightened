# Survive the Night: Re-Enlightened
This is the brand new Survive the Night game it is no longer about the lore of FNAF but it's just a spin-off a story with a new beginning and a fatal ending but can you help to change the future?<br/>
It all started when a man who lost everything and applied for a job at the local Pizzeria in his town he arrived at his job in time every day but one day... he died... in death he started reliving those last few days before he died and you are tasked with saving this man and changing his fate... but the real question is... can you save him...?  
Now im going to tell you about the pizzeria, this pizzeria consists of six animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Golden Freddy and an animatronic that's under testing and their name is Ronnie Anne. Freddy is a bear who loves to sing and occasionally laugh but at night his laughing is ominous and scary, Bonnie is a friendly bunny who plays his guitar on stage to entertain kids but at night he is not so friendly anymore, next is Chica she is a chicken and loves to eat pizza but at night pizza isn't the only thing she will eat.., up next is Foxy he is a pirate fox who goes on adventerous stories with the kids and he has a hook for a hand but when night falls he uses that hook to his advantage, second to last Golden Freddy is a yellow bear who never gets shown to the kids but when the place closes you can see figures and hear laughter echo throughout the halls or the golden bear, finally is Ronnie Anne they are a racoon who loves to turn on every now and then during the day but at night they will try to rip the power cords out of the generator so shock them when they try to destroy the generator.
